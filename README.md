# AI-based Music Plagiarism Detection System ðŸŽ¶

A sophisticated, web-based platform designed to detect potential plagiarism in musical compositions. This system uses a **hybrid analysis model**, providing a final weighted score based on similarity from both deep learning embeddings and manually extracted melodic features.

## Features

-   **Web Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for uploading audio files.
-   **Hybrid Analysis:** Employs a dual-pathway system for robust analysis:
    -   **Deep Learning:** A CNN trained on spectrograms generates dense melody embeddings.
    -   **Algorithmic Extraction:** Manually defined algorithms extract key melodic and rhythmic features.
-   **Weighted Scoring System:** Combines the results from both analysis methods to produce a more accurate and nuanced final similarity score.
-   **Cosine Similarity:** Uses cosine similarity to compare the vector representations from the CNN.

## How It Works

The plagiarism detection process follows a multi-stage approach to ensure comprehensive analysis:

1.  **Upload & Preprocessing:** A user uploads one audio file. The backend converts each file into a spectrogram, a visual representation of the audio's frequency spectrum over time. 

2.  **Dual Analysis Pathway:** The system processes the spectrograms through two parallel pipelines to extract musical features:
    * **A) CNN-based Embedding Generation:** The spectrograms are fed into a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN generates dense **melody embeddings**â€”high-dimensional vectors that capture abstract, learned patterns in the music.
    * **B) Manual Feature Extraction:** Simultaneously, separate algorithms directly analyze the audio signals to extract a set of predefined melodic features (e.g., pitch contours, note sequences, rhythmic patterns).

3.  **Similarity Calculation:** A similarity score is calculated independently for each pathway:
    * $S_{\text{cnn}}$: The **cosine similarity** is computed between the two CNN-generated melody embeddings.
    * $S_{\text{manual}}$: A similarity score is computed for the manually extracted feature sets.

4.  **Weighted Score Combination:** The final plagiarism score is a weighted sum of the similarities from both pathways. This allows for fine-tuning the system's sensitivi  ty   to different aspects of musical composition. 

5.  **Result Display:** The final weighted score is converted to a percentage and displayed to the user.
